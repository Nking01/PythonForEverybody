# PythonForEverybody
Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog) </br>
- The goal of my project is to complete my GameMaker course 

Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do) </br>
- To start, I want to learn by watching tutorials and gaining knowledge on how to create a game, then end with a game of my own using the concepts that I learned and letting the system and others try out my game. I want my game to be fun and interactive for the users

Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)
- To create my own game that is completed with the resources and constraints that are in place

Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system) </br>
- I will be completing the course for free, so I will not have access to all the resources that they offer and I will be under a time limit

Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof) </br>
- The free trial for the course is up for 30 days, then I would have to pay for it in order to continue
- I have downloaded the required software and apps needed to start and finish the course.


Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations) </br>
- Professor: for grading my projects and assignments
- Parents: for paying 25% for my education and helping get to this point in my life
- Bright Futures: for also paying 75% of my education
- Prospective Employers: this will be added to my portfolio to help gain the attention of employers that want to give me a job

Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs) </br>
- There is no set timeline, I just need to create the game in the 30 day window they give me for the free trial. I can look at video and written tutorials that will guide me into creating specific games with specific processes and can help me learn more about how to code a game.
